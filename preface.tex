V.F. contributed field support and advice on experimental design, while F.L. performed the DGGE analysis of bacterial diversity and A.C counted protists. Chapter 3 is co-authored with D. S. S. and G. Q. Romero, who contributed to the ideas and field support. Chapter 4 is co-authored with D. S. S., who also collected the observational data used in that chapter, while A.A.M.M.D. collected the experimental data.
