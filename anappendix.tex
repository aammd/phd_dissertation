\caption{Pairwise differences in two measures of size response. Each point represents a
pair of species, divided into species pairs within the same genus (top)
the same family (middle) and order (bottom). The left panel shows
differences in \(A^{*}\) values (units are ml) while the right panel
shows differences in \(x\) (slopes of logistic regression). Species
pairs which are different from a null model are shaded.}

\caption{Standardized effect sizes (SES) of pairwise differences
between species for two different measures of patch size response.
These two measures are critical patch size (\(A^{*}\)) and strength of
patch size dependency (\(x\)). Pairwise differences are shown within
each of three taxonomic levels. Significant standardized effect sizes
(randomization p-value \textless{} 0.05) are indicated with points.}
