This is a fork of Rich FitzJohn's original work.  I am attempting to modify it to work on Ubuntu Linux.

Any errors to do with `fontenc.sty` and `Metric (TFM) not found` can be solved by installing `texlive-fonts-extra` and `texlive-math-extra`.

Designed to work with minon pro -- see [here](https://gist.github.com/richfitz/2324707) for installation instructions.  Will fall back on Palatino.
