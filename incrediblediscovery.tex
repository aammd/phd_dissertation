\section{A section}

The formatting in this style is understated compared with most styles:
no bold serifs and relatively small differences in sizes between types.

\subsection{A subsection}

Subsections are't that much smaller

\subsubsection{A sub subsection}

These are equivalent to the usual paragraph.
