\section{A section}

The formatting in this style is understated compared with most styles:
no bold serifs and relatively small differences in sizes between types.

\subsection{A subsection}

Subsections are't that much smaller

\subsubsection{A sub subsection}

These are equivalent to the usual paragraph (Table \ref{table:sample}).

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[h]
\caption[Sample table]{A sample table to test the formatting in the list of tables.  How does
		 a table with a very long caption look?  Does it fit in the list?}
\label{table:sample}
\vspace{10pt}
\begin{tabular}[c]{l l l}
\hline
This 		& Is A 			& Table \\ \hline
Here are 	& some things	& in the table \\
Three		& more			& Things \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}
